# Vintage Typewriter App

## üõ† Architecture Overview

* **Single-Activity** with **Jetpack Compose** (`ComponentActivity`) as UI host.
* **MVVM**:

  * **ViewModel** handles keystroke logging, canvas state, playback, and export logic.
  * **Repository/Use‚Äëcases** for saving/loading sessions, exporting assets.
* **State flow / Compose State** used throughout:

  * `MutableState<CanvasModel>` for current canvas image and cursor position.
  * `MutableStateFlow<List<KeystrokeEvent>>` in ViewModel for playback restoration.

---

## üé® Canvas-Based Typing UI

* Use `Canvas(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { ‚Ä¶ }`.
* Draw characters manually using:

  * `val textMeasurer = rememberTextMeasurer()` ([developer.android.com][1], [blog.kotlin-academy.com][2], [arxiv.org][3], [stackoverflow.com][4])
  * In `DrawScope`, use `drawText(textMeasurer, char, position, style)` to draw each keystroke.
* Cache text layouts via `Modifier.drawWithCache` to minimize overhead ([developer.android.com][1]).
* Maintain a model of typed characters with their offset (x, y), char, timestamp.

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è Input Handling & IME Integration

* Add a hidden/zero-dimensional `BasicTextField` with:

  ```kotlin
  keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(autoCorrect = false, imeAction = ImeAction.None),
  keyboardActions = KeyboardActions(default = { /* noop */ }),
  onTextInputStart = disableSuggestions
  ```
* Use `Modifier.onKeyEvent { ‚Ä¶ }` to intercept keys ([proandroiddev.com][5], [developer.android.com][6]):

  * **Character keys**: push keystroke to ViewModel and update canvas offset.
  * **Backspace**: repurpose as carriage return or strike-through action.
  * **Enter key**: advance to next line.
* Dynamically render each incoming text chunk character-by-character to simulate authentic timing.

---

## üéß Sound Effects

* Centralized sound management using `SoundPool`, configured in ViewModel or DI-ed module ([arxiv.org][3], [wookoo.medium.com][7]).
* Play key click, line-return, and carriage-ding sounds.
* Respect user volume/mute settings.

---

## üåÄ Scrolling & Responsive Layout

* **Tablets/Large screens**: display static viewport showing full document.
* **Phones**: auto-scroll viewport to keep the cursor centered.
* Horizontal scroll: use Compose `ScrollState` synced with canvas offset.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Keystroke Playback and Export

* ViewModel logs keystroke events: `(char, x, y, timestamp)`.
* Provide playback UI with variable speeds (1√ó, 2√ó, 5√ó).

  * Replay by feeding events to rendering routine with adjusted delays.
* Export options:

  * **Bitmaps**: generate via `Canvas` capture.
  * **PDF**: use Android `PdfDocument`.
  * **Video**: render voice, combine audio + visuals using **MediaCodec** or **FFmpeg** wrapper.

---

## üì¶ Export & Saving

* Save session model (list of keystrokes + canvas size) via Room or file.
* Exporting on-demand via ViewModel-triggered use-case:

  * Render frame-by-frame to bitmap and encode.
  * Save to `MediaStore`.

---

## üìÅ File Management & Media Permissions

* Use `Scoped Storage`: `MediaStore` to insert images/videos.
* Use SAF (`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`) for manual Export As.

---

## üß© Additional Components

* UI settings:

  * Toggle paper size.
  * Enable/disable page-flip ink-bleed effect.
  * Sound volume control.
* Back side typing: reuse canvas overlay; blend faint ink bleed.

---

## ‚úÖ Composition & Performance

* Use `remember` for `TextMeasurer`, `SoundPool`, and layout caches.
* Draw text with `drawWithCache` for performance ([appt.org][8], [developer.android.com][1], [developer.android.com][6], [stackoverflow.com][9], [medium.com][10]).
* Handle animations (e.g., playback) using `LaunchedEffect` + `Animatable` or `animate*AsState` ([developer.android.com][11]).

---

## üìÖ Dependencies & APIs

* **Jetpack Compose**: UI + Canvas + Input modifiers + state management
* `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose`
* `androidx.soundpool:soundpool` or native `SoundPool`
* `kotlinx.coroutines` for timing and playback control
* `androidx.compose.animation` for visual transitions
* `PdfDocument`, `MediaStore` for exports
